 * for the resizing tiers, downscales it) into a cache temp file so a smaller copy reaches Drive
 * while the on-device original is never touched. The caller decides image-vs-video and only calls
 * this for an image; video goes through VideoUploadCompressor instead.
 *
 * Every failure mode returns null so the caller falls back to the untouched original: a
 * compression failure must never fail (or block) the upload. The bytes actually sent are what the
 * upload path hashes, sizes, and records, so the SHA-1 / ContentHash / xAttr all describe the
 * recompressed copy. This mirrors the metadata-strip temp-file path in the upload use-case.

     *    channel (flattening to JPEG would lose the transparency). JPEG/HEIC and opaque, non-animated
     *    PNG/WebP still recompress. These guards run before the expensive decode+encode where they can.
     *  - The produced file is not strictly smaller than the source → null, so a compression that
     *    would inflate the file (already-optimised JPEG, tiny image) never ships a larger copy.
     *
     * Sizing: the bitmap is decoded with an [BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize] chosen from a
     * bounds-only pass so a very large image is never fully materialised at native resolution
     * (memory safety). When [UploadCompressionTier.maxLongEdgePx] is greater than 0 and the source's
     * longest edge exceeds it, the decoded bitmap is scaled proportionally to that cap; otherwise
     * full resolution is kept (subject to the sample-size decode).
     *
     * EXIF: [Bitmap.compress] drops all EXIF, so the source orientation is baked into the pixels
     * (the encoded JPEG is upright with orientation NORMAL) and the original EXIF (capture time, GPS,
     * camera make/model, software, ISO, and the rest) is copied back onto the temp via
     * [ExifHelper.copyExifPreservingOrientation] so the compressed upload keeps the photo's metadata.
     * That copy honours [stripConfig]: this path always re-encodes to a fresh JPEG and rebuilds the
     * EXIF from scratch, so gating it here removes the requested groups for every source format,
     * including one whose container ExifInterface cannot rewrite in place (for example HEIC). The
     * default config strips nothing, keeping the full-metadata behaviour when strip-on-upload is off.
