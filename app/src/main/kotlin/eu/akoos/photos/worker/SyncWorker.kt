         * Immediately enqueue a OneTime sync run so the user doesn't have to wait for the next
         * periodic fire (which can be up to 15 min away). The OneTime work uses the same
         * Wi-Fi-only constraint as periodic, then runs as a foreground service so the user
         * sees a notification while it works.
         *
         * Uniqueness ([NAME_ONESHOT]) + [ExistingWorkPolicy.APPEND_OR_REPLACE] means:
         *   - If no worker is running for [NAME_ONESHOT], the request runs immediately.
         *   - If one IS running, this request is APPENDED to run after the current one
         *     finishes. This is the key fix for camera bursts: photo #1 fires the observer,
         *     SyncWorker starts uploading. While it's mid-upload, photos #2, #3, #4 arrive.
         *     With the previous KEEP policy those kicks were silently dropped, and reconcile
         *     never re-queried MediaStore — the unfinished photos would sit until the next
         *     periodic fire OR the next foreground enter. APPEND_OR_REPLACE guarantees a
         *     second pass picks them up.
         *   - APPEND_OR_REPLACE (instead of plain APPEND) means we only ever queue ONE
         *     follow-up — a burst of 20 kicks doesn't queue 20 workers, it queues 1 that
         *     handles whatever pending state the burst left in MediaStore.
