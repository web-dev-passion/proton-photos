/**
 * Quality tier for opt-in upload compression, shared by the photo and the video toggles. Each value
 * carries the JPEG quality plus longest-edge cap the photo path re-encodes at ([maxLongEdgePx] of 0
 * means keep the original dimensions), and the short-edge and frame-rate caps the video path
 * transcodes at (0 and null keep the source's). The ordinal is what
 * gets persisted in [eu.akoos.photos.data.preferences.SettingsKeys.COMPRESS_UPLOAD_TIER], so keep
 * the declaration order stable: reordering silently repoints every saved setting at a different
 * tier. Picker labels and descriptions map to string resources in the settings UI layer.
